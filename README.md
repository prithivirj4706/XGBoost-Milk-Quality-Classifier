## 🚀 Usage

### Training the Model

Before running the application, train the XGBoost model:

```bash
python model.py
```

**What this does:**
- Loads the milk quality dataset (`milk_quality_data.csv`)
- Preprocesses and encodes the data
- Trains multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- Saves the best-performing model as `model.pkl`
- Displays accuracy metrics and confusion matrix

**Sample Output:**
```
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.9623
Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.9547
Gradient Boosting Accuracy: 0.9811
XGBoost Accuracy: 0.9849
XGBoost (Tuned) Accuracy: 0.9906

Model saved to model.pkl
```

### Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Making Predictions

1. **Configure Parameters** in the sidebar:
   - Adjust physical properties (pH, Temperature, Colour)
   - Select chemical properties (Fat content)
   - Choose sensory properties (Taste, Odor)
   - Set turbidity level

2. **Click "🚀 Analyze Quality"** button

3. **View Results**:
   - Quality grade prediction
   - Confidence percentage
   - Status indicator
   - Detailed parameter breakdown
   - Probability distribution

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### Algorithm: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

**Why XGBoost?**
- Superior performance on tabular data
- Handles non-linear relationships effectively
- Built-in regularization prevents overfitting
- Fast training and prediction

### Model Configuration

```python
XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,      # Number of boosting rounds
    max_depth=5,           # Maximum tree depth
    learning_rate=0.1,     # Step size shrinkage
    colsample_bytree=0.5,  # Feature sampling ratio
    random_state=42        # Reproducibility
)
```

### Input Features (7 Parameters)

| Feature | Type | Range | Description |
|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| **pH** | Float | 3.0 - 9.5 | Acidity/alkalinity level |
| **Temperature** | Integer | 20 - 90°C | Storage/processing temperature |
| **Taste** | Binary | 0/1 | Bad (0) or Good (1) |
| **Odor** | Binary | 0/1 | Bad (0) or Good (1) |
| **Fat** | Binary | 0/1 | Not Optimal (0) or Optimal (1) |
| **Turbidity** | Binary | 0/1 | Low (0) or High (1) |
| **Colour** | Integer | 240 - 260 | Color measurement value |

### Output Classes

- **0 - Low Quality**: Below acceptable standards
- **1 - Medium Quality**: Acceptable but improvable
- **2 - High Quality**: Excellent quality standards

## 📊 Dataset Information

### Source
The model is trained on `milk_quality_data.csv`, a comprehensive dataset containing real-world milk quality measurements.

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Total Samples**: 1,059 records
- **Features**: 7 input parameters + 1 target variable
- **Target Distribution**: Balanced across Low, Medium, and High grades
- **Missing Values**: None (complete dataset)

### Data Preparation
1. **Encoding**: Target variable mapped (low→0, medium→1, high→2)
2. **Splitting**: 70% training, 30% testing
3. **No Scaling**: XGBoost naturally handles different scales

## 🔌 API Reference

### Model Input Format

```python
import pandas as pd

input_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'ph': [6.6],
    'temperature': [45],
    'taste': [1],          # 0 = Bad, 1 = Good
    'odor': [1],           # 0 = Bad, 1 = Good
    'fat': [1],            # 0 = Not Optimal, 1 = Optimal
    'turbidity': [0],      # 0 = Low, 1 = High
    'colour': [254]
})
```

### Making Predictions

```python
from joblib import load

# Load trained model
model = load('model.pkl')

# Predict quality grade
prediction = model.predict(input_data)[0]  # Returns: 0, 1, or 2

# Get confidence scores
probabilities = model.predict_proba(input_data)[0]
# Returns: [prob_low, prob_medium, prob_high]

# Example output
print(f"Predicted Grade: {prediction}")
print(f"Confidence: {probabilities[prediction] * 100:.2f}%")
```

### Output Interpretation

```python
grade_mapping = {
    0: "Low Quality",
    1: "Medium Quality",
    2: "High Quality"
}
